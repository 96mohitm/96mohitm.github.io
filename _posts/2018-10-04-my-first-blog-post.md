Hi, **Welcome** to my blog.

This is the first ever blog that I am posting in my blog.
I am **Mohit Musaddi**, currently a **Third** year B. Tech student at Techno India Saltlake, Kolkata.

Till now I been focusing on *competitive coding* and **algorithms**, as I like to do challenging problems, espescially the ones which I am unable to do because these are the ones which pushes me to the edge and makes me learn new concepts and also because I love Mathematics and coding.

I am also having some experience with *frontend development* as I have done an **Internship** in a Startup in Kolkata for about two and a half months. It was a great experience.

## The motive of starting this blog:

There are many good resources out there but have little support if you get stuck in something, obviously, there are many sites and Bootcamp which provide support but charge tons of money. And the next most important is the roadmap to achieve anything.


I will try to help with problems discussed above and fill the gap. And this will also help in improving my writing skills in English, as I am not so good at this.

Let me know if you have some *feedback*.
